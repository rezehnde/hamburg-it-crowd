## Moving to Hamburg
A good strategy is to rent a temporary apartment for three months, and use this time to find a suitable neighborhood and apartment for you. Moreover most of the landlords prefer to rent an apartment to someone who has at least three payslips issued by a German company. So, maybe you will stay for six months in a temporary apartment.

### Steps
#### 1. Rent a temporary apartment
_Important: you should choose a flat which gives you a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung (landlord's confirmation of residence)._

Rent an apartment before arriving into Hamburg on one of these websites (even these would require a deposit beforehand):
- https://wunderflats.com/
- https://www.city-wohnen.de/

The best choice would be hire a Gästewohnunguen (temporary flat) and apply to a Wohnanlagen (long period rent) at:
- https://www.fluwog.de/service/gaestewohnungen/
- https://www.fluwog.de/wohnen/wohnanlagen/

There are more companies like Flugwog listed on Hamburger Wohnbaugenossenschaften website:

#### 2. Buy a pre-paid SIM card
As soon as you arrive in Hamburg, buy a pre-paid SIM card from a telecommunications company. If you are planning to get internet and tv in the future in your next home, probably the best choice would be some big telecommunication company which could sell you a complete subscription including mobile phones, tv, and internet.

Good options are:
- https://www.simplytel.de/
- https://www.vodafone.de/
- https://www.blau.de

Could be needed to prove your identity to buy a SIM card. For that you will need to download this app:

#### 3. Register yourself into the city
You should register your new address (Anmeldung) within two weeks after moving into your new home in Hamburg (this goes for any city in Germany). Everytime you move, even inside the same city, you need to register your new address.
